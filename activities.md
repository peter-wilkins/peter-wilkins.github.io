### The Mothership

 ![Snowgoose 6m trimaram](/assets/img/snowgoose.png)

 Snowgoose is a 6m trimaran, stable, spacious and fast.

 Great as a base for activities and adventures or for lazing in the sun

### Paddleboarding adventures

When the weather is calmer we can sail upwind and then paddle with the wind along the shore exploring the wildlife, geology and history of the harbour.

todo - example gps track, post about a trip

### Wingfoiling lessons and rental

Fly above the water powered by nature (and a good breakfast hopefully).

I call this falling off in three dimensions, but after a few sessions you may be dangerously addicted.

This sport is fast growing in popularity as it isn't as physically demanding as windsurfing and easier to control than kitesurfing. Well, thats why it is my goto.

The hand held wing allows you to manage the power of the wind more easily and provides floation when you take a dip.

Still a good workout so I recommend you use your goals as motivation to get in shape first, you will thank yourself later.
