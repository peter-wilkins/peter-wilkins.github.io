title: About me

My name is Peter Wilkins

This site is basically a record of my permaculture projects and ramblings.

Subjects include offgrid living, sea farming, tree nurseries, etc.

I live near Weymouth in the UK, a stones throw from Portland Harbour.

If you find any of it interesting and want to collaberate please get in touch.

I offer sailing and paddleboarding trips, plus wingfoiling and windsurfing lessons, preferably on a barter basis (money is so boring). I prefer it if there is some creative or personal angle.

Basic camping space is also a possibility in the summer. Come do some wwoofing and we can bunk off when the conditions are good on the water.

Examples of goods or services I might accept in return:
- organic gardening
- safety cover boat driver (RYA safety boat qualification required)
- Cad drafting
- house building skills
- sculptures
- ...

I'm open to any suggestions so drop me a line

If we can't find a 121 barter that works then a bit of money can balance things out and grease the wheels.
