title: About me
---

My name is Peter Wilkins

This site is basically a record of my permaculture projects and ramblings.

Subjects include offgrid living, sea farming, tree nurseries, etc.

I live near Weymouth in the UK, a stones throw from Portland Harbour.

If you find any of it interesting and want to collaberate please get in touch.

I teach sailing, windsurfing, wingfoiling on a barter basis (money is so boring). Prefer it if there is a personal angle.

Examples of goods or services I might accept in return:
- Cad drafting
- building services
- gardening
- sculptures
- ...

I'm open to suggestions so drop me a line
